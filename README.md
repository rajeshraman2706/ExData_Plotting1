This is my repository for the Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis". 
Currently there are 8 files for the Course Project 1: 4 png pictures and 4 scripts to generate each.

To run this script you need to to the following:

Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to some directory;
Download the data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;
Extract the data into the same directory;
From the R Prompt:

setwd("<Your working directory where you have all the scripts and the text file you downloaded");
source("Plot1.R");
source("Plot2.R");
source("Plot3.R");
source("Plot4.R");
